# GoNN
Go Neural Networks is a minimalist neural network library currently in development for Go.


## Objective
I aim to develop a simple but effective tool for creating typical neural network structures.
This tool should be easy to use and understand but still effective for many tasks.

Given that everything goes well (and I have time) I plan to use this as a backend for a webapp demonstrating how neural networks work with source readily available for those interested.
